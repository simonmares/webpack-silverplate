This is a fork of https://github.com/FerJSsilva/webpack-4-react-boilerplate.

Minimal webpack/react boilerplate:

- **npm dev** starts development server
- **npm build** creates production bundle

## webpack features

- images loaders
- css loader
- hot reload
- production build optimized

## babel features

- react
- env
- stage-0

## Motivation

The purpose is purely educational. It should make clear whats necessary to start developing client-side apps (like `create-react-app`).

User can add custom configs (TypeScript, sass, ...) and tooling (prettier, jest, ...) from existing tutorials.
