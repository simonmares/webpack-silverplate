This is a fork of https://github.com/FerJSsilva/webpack-4-react-boilerplate.

Modern and minimal **webpack 4** / **babel 7** / react boilerplate:

- **npm dev** starts development server
- **npm build** creates production bundle

## webpack features

- images loaders
- css loader
- hot reload
- production build optimized

## babel features

- @babel/preset-env
- @babel/preset-react

## Motivation

The purpose is purely educational. It should make clear whats necessary to start developing client-side apps (like `create-react-app`).

User can add custom configs (TypeScript, sass, ...) and tooling (prettier, jest, ...) from existing tutorials.

Webpack is there from 2012, its gonna stay for some time, lets embrace it.
